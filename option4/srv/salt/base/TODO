cleanup master configuration
    - should be a slimmer set of things we actually need
    - disable auto_accept
    - shared job_cache

syndic bugs:
    - tcp transport can't handle list targets through a syndic
        -- right now the tcp transport in a list situation just finds the clients for that
            we can either maintain the presence map *through* the syndic, or track the
            syndics separately so that we broadcast things to syndic if the target isn't
            directly connected
